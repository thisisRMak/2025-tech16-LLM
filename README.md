# Archive of my links and homeworks from Tech16 LLM for Business (2025)

In 2025 winter, I'm taking Tech16. This is a Stanford Continuing Education class, titled LLM for Business with Python. It's taught by Charlie Flannagan. 

I'm using this repo as my private archive for useful links and the homeworks I'm completing during this class.
