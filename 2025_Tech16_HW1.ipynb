Each branch has specific roles and responsibilities, and they interact to ensure a system of accountability and oversight. \n\n## 1. Legislative Branch\n- **Role:** The legislative branch is responsible for making laws. It consists of the Congress, which is divided into two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n- **Elected Leaders:** Members of Congress are elected by the people.\n- **Term Limits:** Senators serve 6-year terms with no limit, while Representatives serve 2-year terms with no limit. \n\n## 2. Executive Branch\n- **Role:** The executive branch is responsible for enforcing laws. It is headed by the President of the United States.\n- **Elected Leader:** The President is elected by the Electoral College.\n- **Term Limits:** The President can serve a maximum of two 4-year terms.\n\n## 3. Judicial Branch\n- **Role:** The judicial branch interprets and applies laws. It consists of the Supreme Court and other federal courts.\n- **Appointed Leaders:** Federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices, are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n- **Term Limits:** Federal judges serve for life unless they resign, retire, or are impeached.\n\n## Interactions among the Branches\n- **Checks and Balances:** Each branch has the power to check and limit the actions of the other branches to prevent abuse of power.\n- **Example:** The President can veto legislation passed by Congress, but Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote.\n\n### Interaction Examples:\n1. **Legislative and Executive:** Congress can pass laws, but the President can veto them. However, Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds majority.\n2. **Legislative and Judicial:** Congress can impeach federal judges, and the Senate can confirm or reject judicial appointments made by the President.\n3. **Executive and Judicial:** The President appoints federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices, with the Senate's consent.\n\nIn conclusion, the US government functions through a system of checks and balances among the three branches to ensure accountability and prevent the concentration of power. Elected leaders in the legislative and executive branches have specific term limits, while appointed leaders in the judiciary serve for life. This structure is designed to uphold the principles of democracy and protect the rights of the American people."

Each branch has a distinct role in the functioning of the government and there are mechanisms in place to ensure a system of checks and balances among these branches.\n\n## Executive Branch\n\n### Elected Leadership\nThe Executive Branch is headed by the President of India, who is elected by an electoral college comprising of members of both houses of the Parliament and the state legislatures. The President is the ceremonial head of the state and exercises powers in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister.\n\n#### Term Limits\nThe President serves a term of five years and can be re-elected for a second term.\n\n### Appointed Leadership\nThe Prime Minister is the head of government and is appointed by the President. The Council of Ministers consists of ministers who are appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\n## Legislature\n\nThe Indian Parliament is bicameral, consisting of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People). Members of both houses are elected by the citizens of India.\n\n### Term Limits\nMembers of the Lok Sabha serve a term of five years, after which general elections are held. Members of the Rajya Sabha serve a term of six years, with one-third of the members retiring every two years.\n\n## Judiciary\n\nThe Judiciary in India is independent and is headed by the Supreme Court of India, which is the highest judicial body in the country. It has the power of judicial review and ensures that laws passed by the Legislature and actions of the Executive comply with the Constitution.\n\n### Appointed Leadership\nJudges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President on the advice of the Chief Justice of India and a collegium of senior judges.\n\n#### Term Limits\nThere is no fixed term limit for judges of the Supreme Court. They retire at the age of 65.\n\n## Interactions Among Branches\n\n### Checks and Balances\nThe Executive is responsible for implementing laws passed by the Legislature, while the Judiciary interprets these laws and ensures their constitutionality. The Legislature holds the Executive accountable through debates, questioning, and passing of legislation.\n\n### Interaction\nThe President acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers, who are members of the Legislature. The Judiciary can strike down laws passed by the Legislature if they are found to be unconstitutional.\n\nIn conclusion, the Indian government comprises three branches, each with its distinct roles and responsibilities. While the Executive and Judiciary have appointed leadership, the Legislature consists of elected members. The term limits for leaders vary, with the President serving a five-year term, Members of the Lok Sabha serving five years, Rajya Sabha members serving six years, and Supreme Court judges retiring at the age of 65. The system of checks and balances ensures the smooth functioning of the government and prevents the concentration of power in any one branch."
